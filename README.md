# Traffic
# This is a JAVA Program that simulates Traffic and Traffic Lights.
# Cars are randomly added to a queue until they are 100.
# The Yellow light lasts for 10 seconds, the Green light lasts for 30 seconds and the Red Light lasts for 20 seconds
# When when the light is green the cars go , one by one (every second a car gets out )
# When the light is yellow , the cars go , one by one (every two seconds one  car gets out , because yellow is for caution so the cars are going a little slower )
# When the light is red, no car gets to go . They all stay where they are.
# The program only ends when all the cars in your collection are gone.
